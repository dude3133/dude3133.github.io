        <h3>History of HTML</h3>
        HTML was created by Berners-Lee in late 1991 but "HTML 2.0" was the first standard HTML specification which was published in 1995.
        HTML 4.01 was a major version of HTML and it was published in late 1999.
        Though HTML 4.01 version is widely used but currently we are having HTML-5 version which is an extension to HTML 4.01, and this version was published in 2012.
        Now most of web browsers supporst HTML5.
